# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free
environment for everyone, regardless of background, experience, or identity. We
strive to foster a positive and inclusive community where all participants feel
valued and empowered to contribute.

## Our Standards

### Expected behavior

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

### Unacceptable behavior

* Harassment, discrimination, or offensive comments regarding identity,
  appearance, or background
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Personal attacks, insults, or disruptive behavior that undermines the
  community
* Posting content or engaging in activities that are inappropriate, unlawful, or
  harmful

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
<conduct@livekit.io>.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in removal from the community,
project, or repository. Severe violations may result in a permanent ban.
