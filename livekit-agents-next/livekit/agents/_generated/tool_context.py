# Edit the Rust declaration and re-run `cargo run -p lk-agents-codegen -- --write`. CI regenerates and fails on a

"""What counts as a duplicate of an in-flight call, i.e. what ``on_duplicate`` acts on.

``"name"``           any in-flight call of the same tool (default).
``"name_and_args"``  same tool *and* same arguments, so concurrent calls of one
                     tool with different arguments are not duplicates::

                     Arguments are compared *after* validation, so a parameter the
                     LLM omitted on one call and passed explicitly on the next still
                     reads as the same call, and ``1`` matches ``1.0`` for a ``float``
                     parameter. Raw function tools (including MCP tools) have no
                     per-parameter schema, so their arguments are compared as sent.

                     Comparison fails open — an unrepresentable argument or a
                     validation error leaves the call treated as sent rather than
                     blocking it — so don't rely on this as an exactly-once
                     guarantee; put that in the tool body.
