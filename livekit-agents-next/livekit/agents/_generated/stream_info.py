# Written by `cargo run -p lk-agents-codegen -- --write` (in `rust/`) from the `#[host(record)]`
# declarations in:
#     rust/crates/lk-agents-abi/src/voice/rtc.rs
#
# Edit the Rust declaration and re-run `cargo run -p lk-agents-codegen -- --write`. CI regenerates and fails on a
# non-empty diff, so a hand edit here is reverted rather than merged.
