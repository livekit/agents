# Rime plugin for LiveKit Agents

Support for voice synthesis with the [Rime](https://rime.ai/) API.

See [https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/tts/rime/](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/tts/rime/) for more information.

## Installation

```bash
pip install livekit-plugins-rime
```

## Pre-requisites

You'll need an API key from Rime. It can be set as an environment variable: `RIME_API_KEY`

## Streaming WebSocket v1 API

The Rime v1 WebSocket protocol accepts streaming text and returns audio before the input turn
is complete. The plugin aggregates input fragments into complete sentences before it sends them
to Rime. All sentences in one LiveKit output turn use one continuous synthesis context.

```python
import os

from livekit.plugins import rime

tts = rime.TTS(
    websocket_url="wss://api.rime.ai/coda/ws",
    speaker="astra",
    api_key=os.environ["RIME_API_KEY"],
)
```

Pass the active model WebSocket endpoint explicitly. The presence of `websocket_url` selects
WebSocket v1 streaming. The plugin reads the model from the path segment before `/ws`, such as
`coda` in `/coda/ws` or `mistv3` in `/mistv3/ws`. Do not pass `model` with `websocket_url`.

The `websocket_protocol` option accepts `binary` or `json`. It defaults to `binary`, which uses the
`rime.v1.binary` subprotocol and protobuf binary frames. Set `websocket_protocol="json"` to use the
`rime.v1.json` subprotocol and canonical proto3 JSON text frames.

The speaker defaults to `astra` for Coda and `cove` for Mist v3. The plugin uses
`livekit.agents.tokenize.blingfire.SentenceTokenizer` by default and configures it to emit one
complete sentence at a time. Pass `tokenizer` to select another LiveKit sentence tokenizer. A
custom tokenizer must emit complete sentence units that are safe for Rime text normalization.

Mist v3 uses the same stream implementation:

```python
tts = rime.TTS(
    websocket_url="wss://api.rime.ai/mistv3/ws",
    speaker="cove",
    pause_between_brackets=True,
    api_key=os.environ["RIME_API_KEY"],
)
```

One LiveKit stream uses one continuous Rime synthesis context. These stream methods map to the
Rime lifecycle as follows:

| LiveKit method | Local action | Rime operation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stream.push_text()` | Buffer and sentence-tokenize text. | Send `text` for each completed sentence. |
| `stream.flush()` | Release the current tokenizer buffer and keep the context open. | Send released content as `text`; no `flush` operation exists. |
| `stream.end_input()` | Drain final text and finalize input. | Send `end`. |
| `stream.aclose()` | Stop active synthesis. | Send `cancel` when needed. |

You can send more text after `flush()`. The same Rime context remains active, and an input pause
needs no wire message. Only `end_input()` ends normal input and causes Rime to send `done`.
Each outgoing `text` value must be a stable sentence-sized unit. Calling `flush()` drains any
buffered fragment, so call it only after a complete sentence or a stable clause.

The v1 implementation has these limits:

- It requests raw `audio/pcm` data.
- It does not provide aligned word timestamps.
- `speed_alpha` is not supported. Use `time_scale_factor` to control speed.
- The adapter reuses WebSocket connections between sequential LiveKit streams. It does not run
  concurrent contexts on one WebSocket. Concurrent LiveKit streams use separate pooled
  WebSocket connections.
