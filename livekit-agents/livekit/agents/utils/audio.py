    Buffer and chunk audio byte data into fixed-size frames.

    This class is designed to handle incoming audio data in bytes,
    buffering it and producing audio frames of a consistent size.
    It is mainly used to easily chunk big or too small audio frames
    into a fixed size, helping to avoid processing very small frames
    (which can be inefficient) and very large frames (which can cause
    latency or processing delays). By normalizing frame sizes, it
    facilitates consistent and efficient audio data processing.
