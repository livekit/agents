"""
This is an example voice agent that uses Amazon Nova Sonic and showcases how to:
 - set system prompt
 - pass in a ChatContext to the agent
 - set tool_choice
 - configure the inference parameters of the model
 - register tools

There is an event loop that waits for a participant to join the room
and then starts the agent session. The agent session is closed when the participant leaves.

Try asking the agent to tell a joke about a specific category!

There was once an old man and old woman who were not blessed with little ones.
The home seemed bare, with no children to skitter through the kitchen,
make pillow castles, or laugh in the four corners of the cottage.
The garden felt wintry, with no bright legs dangling from the branches of the trees.

"Old man", said the old woman.
"I yearn for a son. There is a log in the yard. Will you carve it into a boy for us?"
The old man carved the log into the shape of a boy. It was strong, brown, and solidly built.
The old woman wept with happiness when she saw it. She kissed the tip of its nose and
placed it in the same cradle she herself had slept in as a child.
The next day, the log was gone. In its place was a soft, curled, sleeping little human.
It had turned into a real boy.
His mother called him Ivaysk-- Little Stick.
