# This example demonstrates the pre-connect audio buffer for instant connect feature.
# It captures what users say during connection time so they don't need to wait for the connection.
# The process works in three steps:
# 1. RoomIO is set up with pre_connect_audio=True
# 2. When connecting to the room, the client sends any audio spoken before connection
# 3. This pre-connection audio is combined with new audio after connection is established
