# Avatar Examples

Avatars provide a visual representation for agents. This collection showcases three different technical approaches to avatar implementation:


### audio_wave

A simple local mock demo that visualizes audio input as waveforms. This approach:
- Provides a lightweight visualization that runs locally
- Functions without requiring external services
- Processes all visualization locally with minimal latency

### bey

The bey example shows how to integrate with the [Beyond Presence API](https://docs.bey.dev/introduction) for avatar generation. This approach:
- Utilizes a third-party service for avatar rendering
- Implements API request/response handling
- Requires network connectivity and API authentication
